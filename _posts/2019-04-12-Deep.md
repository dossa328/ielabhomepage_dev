Definition of Deep Learning
---
Deep learning is a class of machine learning algorithms 

* use a cascade of multiple layers of nonlinear processing units for feature extraction and transformation. Each successive layer uses the output from the previous layer as input.

* learn in supervised (e.g., classification) and/or unsupervised (e.g., pattern analysis) manners.

* learn multiple levels of representations that correspond to different levels of abstraction; the levels form a hierarchy of concepts.
